# Election_Analysis
## Backgroun
In this module, I will be learning and using Python 3 programming language to perform an analysis on election results.  I will be assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee Tom in an election audit.  I will be responsible for calculating the total votes cast, the total votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.  
## Lesson 1
This lesson consisted of learning about the command line, installing Python, installing GitBash, setting up a python environment, installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and creating and cloning a GitHub repository.  
## Lesson 2
Lesson two was about learning Python.  We created and executed a Python file, learned about data types, performed calculations, were introduced to data structures, decision statement, membership and logical operators, repetition statements and printing formats.  
## Lesson 3
I imported and inspected the election data file and learned the importance of pseudocode.  I have a roadmap for the project; I need to retreive the following data:  
  * The total number of vosts cast
  * A complete list of the candidates that received votes
  * The percentage of votes received for each candidate
  * The total number of votes each candidate received
  * The overall winner of the election as per the popular vote

## Lesson 4
I opened and read the data file.  I also learned about dependencies, modules and packages in Python.
